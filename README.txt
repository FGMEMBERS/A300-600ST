Since mid 2007 til now I was surprised by the number of  messages posted in 
Flightgear forums by a lot of  people looking for this airplane and asking why 
it is available for almost all the other flight simulators and not for 
Flightgear !?
I'm interested in this kind of  weird planes,so I decided to stop seeking 
answers and to start building it .
It took me a lot of  time to gather  the needed informations(schemas,images 
and articles etc...)to start with Blender .
I do not pretend it  is as perfect as it should be but I think it would temporary 
fill the gap til a Flightgear develloper decides to build something better .
Many liveries are available including a fictitious one.

    
Note :

1-The A300 and the A300-600ST Beluga real main panels are not 
the same.The Beluga one has been subject to many changes: 
Some instruments have been added and some others have been 
removed.
 
2-There are only Inner ailerons in the real Beluga(I'm not able to 
put some Images here because they are copyrighted but  you can 
check them easily by typing "A300-600ST Beluga images '' on your 
browser).For example you can find both outer and inner ailerons in B-747.

History :

The A300-600ST Super Transporter was the best alternative for Airbus Industrie to replace it's aging fleet of B-337SGT_Super Guppies which the company had bought from Aerospacelines in the 70s' of the last century.A more capacious airplane was needed to ferry oversize subassemblies (wings, fuselages) between the partners' factories  throughout Europe.
Therefore, Airbus decided to use the same concept used for building the Super Guppy : Modifying an existing airplane(A300-600R).
The first A300-600ST was built in Toulouse, France,and rolled out in June 1994.Four Belugas had been delivered by 1998 followed by the fifth in 2001  which allowed the smooth retirement of the Super Guppies in 1997.
